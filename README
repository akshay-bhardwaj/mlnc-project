Problem 1(a): K nearest neighbors

1. Pass first half of unsorted data set. For optimisation perspective : Sort the data based on output ([0,1]) and then take first half of both sorted(0) and sorted(1)
2. While passing parameters from TrainClassifier to Classifier, pass following params:
              a. K 
              b. Distance Matrix (rather then passing the training set

********
I guess Joernano was correct! I case of k nearest algorithm, training involves passing the input matrix along with the k as parameters to the TrainClassifier.
